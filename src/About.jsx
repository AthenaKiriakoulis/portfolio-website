      CS-135 is a pretty difficult class, it's your own fault for starting the homework within
       an hour or so of its due date when you had over a week to work on it, you should be realizing
        what you need help with and asking others for help or possibly collaborating with a partner 
        if you prefer. You are not being passive aggressive when starting the assignment this late, 
        it's your own fault. Manage your time better. This is your first problem set for this class,
        so now you should know how difficult they are and how long they can take you. Consider these
        words because the problem sets will become more difficult as the semester progresses, and 
        there clearly won't be many people who have the patience to assist you in procrastinating,
        while having to do their own work as well. This server is a community to help each other,
         not to give each other quick answers right before the deadline and not actually learn the
        material. Invest a little bit of more time in the class, you can do well while learning 
        interesting and useful, with help along the way if you need it. It doesn't require damaging
        your social life if you are responsible. Everyone can do it, if you put in the effort!
